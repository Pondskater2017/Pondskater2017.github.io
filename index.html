        <h2>The Burns View</h2>
        <p>Yon wild mossy mountains sae lofty and wide, 
That nurse in their bosom the youth o' the Clyde, 
Where the grouse lead their coveys thro' the heather to feed, 
And the shepherd tends his flock as he pipes on his reed.</p> 

<p>Not Gowrie's rich valley, nor Forth's sunny shores, 
To me hae the charms o'yon wild, mossy moors; 
For there, by a lanely, sequestered stream, 
Besides a sweet lassie, my thought and my dream.</p>

<p>Amang thae wild mountains shall still be my path, 
Ilk stream foaming down its ain green, narrow strath; 
For there, wi' my lassie, the day lang I rove, 
While o'er us unheeded flie the swift hours o'love.</p>

<p>She is not the fairest, altho' she is fair; 
O' nice education but sma' is her share; 
Her parentage humble as humble can be; 
But I lo'e the dear lassie because she lo'es me. 
</p>

<p>To Beauty what man but maun yield him a prize, 
In her armour of glances, and blushes, and sighs? 
And when wit and refinement hae polish'd her darts, 
They dazzle our een, as they flie to our hearts.</p>

<p>But kindness, sweet kindness, in the fond-sparkling e'e, 
Has lustre outshining the diamond to me; 
And the heart beating love as I'm clasp'd in her arms, 
O, these are my lassie's all-conquering charms!</p>

          <p>Even for a party largely dismissive of contrary views, the flood of economic analysis and forecasts that point to a hard entrance to independence cannot be forever ignored. Andrew Wilson, a former member of the Scottish parliament, will present a report from his Growth Commission in a few weeks: he has denied saying privately that it would take up to 10 years for the Scottish economy to recover from achieving independence, as widely reported. But both the rhetoric and policy are shifting.

          <img src="http://www.disabledholidays.com/img/up/xScotland.jpg.pagespeed.ic.cBPb7H-LYu.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Robert I (11 July 1274 â€“ 7 June 1329), popularly known as Robert the Bruce (Medieval Gaelic: Roibert a Briuis; modern Scottish Gaelic: Raibeart Bruis; Norman French: Robert de Brus or Robert de Bruys; Early Scots: Robert Brus; Latin: Robertus Brussius), was King of Scots from 1306 until his death in 1329. Robert was one of the most famous warriors of his generation, and eventually led Scotland during the First War of Scottish Independence against England. He fought successfully during his reign to regain Scotland's place as an independent country and is today revered in Scotland as a national hero.</p>

          <p>Scottish immigration to India began with the union of Scotland with England in 1707 to create the United Kingdom.[1] Under the deal, Scotland's landed families gained access to the East India Company, and gradually become its dominant force. Scots came into India as writers, traders, engineers, missionaries, tea and indigo planters, jute traders and teachers. By 1771 almost half of the East India Company's writers were Scots.</p>
